The core classes, functions, and methods that will be necessary are:

1. `Task`: This class will represent a task in the to-do list. It will have properties like `id`, `title`, `description`, `category`, and `status`.

2. `TaskService`: This class will handle all the CRUD operations related to tasks. It will have methods like `create_task`, `get_task`, `update_task`, `delete_task`, and `get_all_tasks`.

3. `Database`: This class will handle all the database operations. It will have methods like `connect`, `disconnect`, `execute_query`, and `fetch_results`.

4. `main`: This is the entry point of the application. It will create an instance of `TaskService` and use it to perform operations based on user input.

Now, let's write the code for each file.
